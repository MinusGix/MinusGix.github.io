This is a summary/commentary on this paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1516 ('Engineering modular and orthogonal genetic logic gates for robust digital-like synthetic biology' by Baojun Wang, Richard I Kitney, Nicolas Joly & Martin Buck)  
  
Note that this is coming from my really basic biology and synthetic biology knowledge, so information and assumptions about what the paper means may be incorrect. Any incorrect information, I would love to have corrected as that would enhance my own knowledge in the field.
